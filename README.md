Applescript to "LangOver"

The general idea is that when you're bilingual, you may start typing in the "other language", and not notice it. This script will convert what you wrote into the language you actually meant to write it in.

The master branch is for U.S. and Hebrew, as this is what I need it for, but I'd like to have more branches for more languages :)

This script has been pieced together from bits and pieces I found around the web (sorry for the lack of attribution, will try to fix in the future).

I invoke the script using BetterTouchTool, but I gather it can be made into a service.
